When you call `myRewindExample.registerEvent()`, you are\r\npushing an event onto the event map at the current point in time. When you rewind time, every \"tick\" we check if there\r\nhave been events that have been stored at that point in time, and we execute them.\r\n\r\nThe eventMap uses the different in time between its initialization (1), and the current time (n) to store events.\r\n\r\nAssuming a `tickDuration` of 1 second, if we initialize the widget, waited 4 seconds, and registered event `f()`,\r\nthe `eventMap` would contain:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    \"5\": [f]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Licensing**:\r\nThis widget is MIT licensed. Feel free to fork and hack away at this as much as you want (just please don't sue me :) )\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-39644992-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
